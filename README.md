Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the application of engineering principles to design, develop and test software.
Importance:
It is the foundation of all digital products like Amazon,Alibaba and Shopify.
Enhances scalability as it provides solution to handle users efficiently
It innovates as in the case of Ai which is used in various industries such as self-driving vehicles and recomendation systems in socials like Instagram and TikTok
It facilitates global connectivity by which has been seen in softtwares such as facebook,whatsapp and X.
It optimizes business operations portrayed by how shopify has enabled its customers to sell online without the need of owning their own stores.



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mobile Revolution:It was spearheaded by Apple which released Iphone in 2007 the first ever smartphone paving way for creation of mobile apps.
CLoud computing:The rise of cloud services like Azure by microsoft,AWS by Amazon and google cloud which has enabled global applications with serverless computing and microservices.
AI,ML and Automation:This is hot take and most recent revolutions still in its early days,we have seen the rise of large language models like chatgpt and Deepseek and its fucntion in automation example in writing code as in the case of github copilot and email writing also.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning:Define the project scope and its objectives
         Identify risks and implimentation costs.
 Requirement analysis:Gather and analyze software requirements from stakeholders.Define functional and non functional requirements.
 Design:Create wireframes ,UI/Ux and database structures and choose a language you will use to build the software
 Implimentation:This involves building of the design by coding ,the code is broken into features and modules
 Testing:Perform unit testing,integration testing ,system testing and user acceptance testing.Bugs are identified and fixed
 Deployment:This is the release of software to production.
 Maintenance and Updates:Provision of ongoing support,bug fixes and updates
 
 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is linear and sequential while agile is iterative and incremental
Waterfall is rigid and difficult to make changes once development starts while agile is highly flexible and changes made anytime
waterfall has low customers input while agile involves customers greatly as they allow their regular feedback

Scenarios for Agile:
                    E-comerce and SaaS
                    Game development
                    Ai and machine learning
 Scenarios for waterfall:
                        Large scale government or defense systems
                        Health care systems
                        Banking and financial systems
                        Automobile industry



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer:
                   Write clean efficient and mantainable code.
                   Develop software based on requirements
                   FIx bugs and optimize performance
                   Integrate Apis,database and third party services
                   Collaborate with designers,QA engineers and project managers
  Quality assurance engineers:
                               Develop test plans,test cases and test scripts
                               Conduct manual and automated testing
                               Identify,report and track bugs and perfomance issues
                               Perform fucntional performancee,security testing and usability testing
                               Ensure requiremnts are met
    Project manager:
                    Define project goals,scope and deadlines
                    Assign tasks and coordinate between developers,designers and QA engineers
                    Ensure team follows development methodology
                    Manage resources,risks and budget
                    Track project progress

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IdEs:
     Increases productivity as it provides tools like autocompletion,synthax highlighting  and debugging
     It helps in righting clean code by features like refactoring linting and templates
     It allows developers by intergrating denugging which can identify erroes and fix within ide
     It allows easy installation of libraries and dependancies
     It suports many programming languages
    Examples:
            Vs code,Vim,Pycharm,intelJ IDEA,eclipse,androidstudio

  Version control systems:
                          

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
