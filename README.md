Mobile Revolution:It was spearheaded by Apple which released Iphone in 2007 the first ever smartphone paving way for creation of mobile apps.
CLoud computing:The rise of cloud services like Azure by microsoft,AWS by Amazon and google cloud which has enabled global applications with serverless computing and microservices.
AI,ML and Automation:This is hot take and most recent revolutions still in its early days,we have seen the rise of large language models like chatgpt and Deepseek and its fucntion in automation example in writing code as in the case of github copilot and email writing also.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning:Define the project scope and its objectives
         Identify risks and implimentation costs.
 Requirement analysis:Gather and analyze software requirements from stakeholders.Define functional and non functional requirements.
 Design:Create wireframes ,UI/Ux and database structures and choose a language you will use to build the software
 Implimentation:This involves building of the design by coding ,the code is broken into features and modules
 Testing:Perform unit testing,integration testing ,system testing and user acceptance testing.Bugs are identified and fixed
 Deployment:This is the release of software to production.
 Maintenance and Updates:Provision of ongoing support,bug fixes and updates
 
 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is linear and sequential while agile is iterative and incremental
Waterfall is rigid and difficult to make changes once development starts while agile is highly flexible and changes made anytime
waterfall has low customers input while agile involves customers greatly as they allow their regular feedback

Scenarios for Agile:
                    E-comerce and SaaS
                    Game development
                    Ai and machine learning
 Scenarios for waterfall:
                        Large scale government or defense systems
                        Health care systems
                        Banking and financial systems
                        Automobile industry



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

                    Assign tasks and coordinate between developers,designers and QA engineers
                    Ensure team follows development methodology
                    Manage resources,risks and budget
                    Track project progress

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IdEs:
     Increases productivity as it provides tools like autocompletion,synthax highlighting  and debugging
     It helps in righting clean code by features like refactoring linting and templates
     It allows developers by intergrating denugging which can identify erroes and fix within ide
     It allows easy installation of libraries and dependancies
     It suports many programming languages
    Examples:
            Vs code,Vim,Pycharm,intelJ IDEA,eclipse,androidstudio

  Version control systems:
                           It allows for multiple developers to work on the same project
                           It keeps record of all changes making it easy to revert to previous versions
                           Developers can work on features separately and merge them later
                           It allows developers to track who made a change and why
                           Examples:Git,GitHub,GitLab,apache and Bitbucket
                          
                          

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Debugging and fixing complex bugs:Solved by using debugging tools like vs code debugger.
Time management and meeting deadlines:Solved by using time management tools example notion,also following the pomodoro techniques and avoiding multitasking.
Handling burnout and mental fatique:Solved by taking regular breaks ,having a work life balance and exercise to maintain good sleep habits. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing:This a type of testing where individual components of a program are tested in isolation to ensure they function properly.
  Importance:
             It ensures early bug detection
             Ensures code reliability
             It facilitates refactoring which is the modification of code 
             It speeds up software development

Integration Testing:It is a technique where multiple components or modules of an application are tested together to verify that they work correctly as a unit.
  Importance:
             It detects interface issues ensuring that different modules communicate correctly
             It prevents data mismatch
             It ensures system reliability

   System Testing:A technique where a fully integrated system is tested as a whole to ensure that it meets specified requirements
    Importance:
                It ensures that all modules work together
                It checks functional and non-functional requirements as it tests usability,security and perfomance
                It ensures that the software is ready for release
                It identifies system wide error
                
Acceptance testing:It is the final phase of software testing where the system is evaluated to ensure it meets business requirements and is ready for deployment

              It validate real world scenarios
              It reduces post-deployment issues
              It boosts user confidence

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing inputs to improve the accuracy ,quality and relevance of  responses by AI models like DeepSeek.
Importance:
           It improves the quality of output by the Ai
           It saves time as it is a one time thing and doesnt involve subsequent instructions to get the right answer.
           It allows users to use Ai maximumly
           It makes interaction with Ai more useful

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Generate an image of a man(This prompt is vague and generalized )
Generate an image of a black man in his early twenties,with a neatly trimmed beard and a taper-fade hair-style,he is wearing classic italian suit and designer shoes while standing next to his .(Unlike the previous prompt this will give me a tailored image that fits my imagination,that is the magic of having a clear prompt).
BMW 7 series car.He posseses a great physique which makes his suit to be appealing and look great.
